# PL/SQL Project

## Overview
This project provides a collection of PL/SQL scripts designed to facilitate various database management tasks. These scripts are ideal for executing complex queries, automating database operations with triggers, and encapsulating business logic within procedures and functions.

## Contents
- **test.sql**: Contains general SQL queries for basic database interactions.
- **Requêtes SQL.sql**: Includes specialized SQL queries for specific operational needs.
- **Procédures et fonctions PL SQL.sql**: Features advanced PL/SQL procedures and functions for complex data manipulation.
- **Déclencheurs.sql**: Comprises triggers that automatically respond to specific database events.

## Setup
To use these scripts, ensure you have access to a SQL database and a client that can run PL/SQL. Import the scripts into your SQL client.

## Usage
To execute a script, connect to your database through your SQL client and run:
```
sqlplus username/password@database @script_name.sql
```
This command will execute the script and apply its operations to the database. Adjust the command based on your SQL client if necessary.

## System Requirements
- Oracle SQL Developer or similar SQL client that supports PL/SQL
- Access to an Oracle Database where you can execute these scripts
```
